# Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, you will learn how to perform sentiment analysis on Reddit posts with the help of Python and the relevant AI models. 

In this Jupyter Notebook, you will see a step-by-step tutorial to build a program that collects data from Reddit on a specified topic, analyzes it to understand the sentiment of the collected data, provides sentiment scores for the data, and then visualizes it through static and interactive graphs, and WordClouds. 

At first, you will use 'TextBlob' to perform sentiment analysis, following which you can switch to the HuggingFace transformer 'RoBERTa' to do an advanced analysis of the data. 

**What changes do you observe when you switch to this advanced AI model?**
